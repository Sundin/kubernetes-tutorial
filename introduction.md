# Chapter 1: Core concepts

This is a very high-level description of the most important concepts of Kubernetes, in case you are new to it.

- A **cluster** is the runtime environment of an entire Kubernetes installation.
- A cluster can be spread across one or more physical **nodes**.
- Inside the cluster, we will deploy our application code in the form of **pods**. Each pod has a well-defined purpose and should be stand-alone.
- Each pod consists of one or more (usually Docker) **containers**.

Continue to [**chapter 2**](./cluster.md) in order to set up your first Kubernetes cluster!
